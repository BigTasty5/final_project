    <h1>The History Of DragonBall Series</h1>
    <h2> Dragonball</h2>

    <P><img src="https://sinqpopculture.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/dragon1.jpg" width="200" height="250">
      Dragon Ball (ドラゴンボール, Doragon Bōru) is an adaptation of the first portion of Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball manga.
      It is composed of 153 episodes around 20-minutes long and ran on Fuji TV from February 26, 1986 to April 12 1989.</P>
    <h3>The Original Series </h3>
    <p>Dragon Ball started off as a manga series called Dragon Boy.
       The story depicted a young boy named Tanton and his quest to return a princess to her homeland.
       The series was a loose adaptation of the Chinese legend Journey to the West, depicting monkey king Sun Wukong.
       Due to the series' unpopularity, Toriyama re-wrote Dragon Boy, adapting it as Dragon Ball.
       All the character's personalities were changed except for Goku. The re-adaptation named Dragon Ball became a hit.
    </p>
    <h3>Broadcast</h3>
    <p>Two previous attempts at releasing Dragon Ball to American audiences failed.
      The first attempt was in 1989 from Harmony Gold USA .
       It featured strange name changes for nearly all the characters, such as changing Goku to "Zero" and Korin to "Whiskers the Wonder Cat".
       It was test-marketed in several cities, but was never broadcast to the general public; therefore it is referred to as "The Lost Dub" by fans.
    </p>
    <p>The second and more well-known attempt was in 1995 with only the first 13 episodes dubbed and aired in first-run syndication.
       This release was a joint-production between Funimation and BLT Productions, with Ocean Studios for the dubbing.
        These original 13 dubbed episodes were later released to DVD by KidMark as "Dragon Ball: The Saga of Goku."
    </p>
  <p> <img src="http://www.fatosdesconhecidos.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/11102.jpg" width="250" height="150">After Dragon Ball Z became immensely popular on Cartoon Network's Toonami block, Dragon Ball was re-translated into English by Funimation's in-house ADR studio for redistribution in the U.S.
      The complete original series aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami from August 20, 2001 to December 1, 2003.
       Unlike the theme songs for Dragon Ball Z and Dragon Ball GT, Funimation made English versions of the original Japanese opening and ending themes for these episodes and left in the original background music.
       Some insert songs were taken out or have talking over them.
    </p>
    <h3>Censorship</h3>
    <p>The U.S. version of Dragon Ball that was aired on Cartoon Network (before that, it was aired in syndication and on NBC in select cities) had many edits done to it.
      Most of the edits were digital cosmetic changes, which were done to remove nudity and blood, and dialogue edits. Sometimes, some scenes were deleted altogether, either to save time or cut out strong violence.
    </P>
    <p>For example, when Goku dives into the water naked to kick a fish he catches for dinner, a digital water splash was added on his groin; on other occasions when he is naked, he has some digital underwear added. Also, references to alcohol and drugs were removed, for example, when Jackie Chun (Master Roshi) uses Drunken Fist Kung Fu in the 21st World Martial Arts Tournament, Funimation called it the "Mad Cow Attack" (coincidentally, there was a real life Mad Cow epidemic shortly after the episode aired). Also, the famous "No Balls!" scene was deleted from episode 2, and when Bulma puts panties on the fishing hook to get Oolong (in fish form), they digitally painted away the panties and replaced it with some money. Also, a number of creative changes were made to the dialogue. For example, when Puar says why Oolong was expelled from school, instead of saying that he stole the teacher's panties, they say that he stole the teacher's "papers."
    </p>
    <p>A lot of fans hated these changes, because they felt it was butchering the original show's humor and dumbing it down.
       These edits, however, were necessary in order to have the show aired on TV. The DVDs do not contain these edits.
    </p>
    <p>It's an interesting note on inconsistency in censorship that a scene in Dragon Ball where young Goku charges completely through King Piccolo, putting a hole in the villain's chest, was edited so that the hole was not shown for the American broadcast, but the same scene was shown on American TV later, in a flashback in a Dragon Ball Z episode, with the hole in King Piccolo's chest clearly visible.
    </p>
    <h2>Dragonball Z</h2>
    <p>Dragon Ball Z (ドラゴンボールＺ, Doragon Bōru Zetto; commonly abbreviated as DBZ) is the long-running sequel to the anime Dragon Ball. The series is a close adaptation of the second (and far longer) portion of the Dragon Ball manga written and drawn by Akira Toriyama. In the United States, the manga's second portion is also titled Dragon Ball Z to prevent confusion for younger readers.
    </p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Dragon Ball Z follows the adventures of the adult Goku who, along with his companions, defends the earth against an assortment of villains ranging from intergalactic space fighters and conquerors, unnaturally powerful androids and near indestructible magical creatures.
      While the original Dragon Ball anime followed Goku through childhood into adulthood, Dragon Ball Z is a continuation of his adulthood life, but at the same time parallels the maturation of his son, Gohan, as well as characters from Dragon Ball and more.
      The separation between the series is also significant as the latter series takes on a more dramatic and serious tone.
      The anime also features characters, situations and back-stories not present in the original manga.
    </p>
    <p>The other names the production was considering for this second series before they settled on Dragon Ball Z were Dragon Ball: Gohan's Big Adventure, New Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball 2, Dragon Ball Wonder Boy, and Dragon Ball 90.
       The anime first premiered in Japan on April 26, 1989 (on Fuji TV) at 7:30 p.m. and ended on January 31, 1996.
       The series average rating was 20.5%, with its maximum being 27.5% (Episode 218) and its minimum being 12.1% (Episode 273).
       Like Dragon Ball, the music for Dragon Ball Z was composed by Shunsuke Kikuchi.
       The character designs for Dragon Ball Z were created by Minoru Maeda from the Raditz Saga to the Cell Games Saga and Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru from the Great Saiyaman Saga to the Kid Buu Saga.
    </p>
    <p>Toriyama's humor/parody manga Nekomajin, released after Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, features several concepts introduced in the series, and several Dragon Ball Z characters make various appearances in this manga.
       After Dragon Ball Z, the story of Goku and friends continues in the anime-only series Dragon Ball GT, which is not based on a manga by Akira Toriyama, but is a project by Toei Animation using the same characters and storyline that serves as a sequel to Dragon Ball Z.
       19 years after the end of Dragon Ball Z in Japan, a new sequel series titled Dragon Ball Super premiered with original concepts by Akira Toriyama, taking place after the death of Kid Buu but before Dragon Ball Z's ending.
    </p>
    <p>In the U.S., the series initially aired in first-run syndication from September 13, 1996 to May 23, 1998, and then aired on Cartoon Network's Toonami block from August 31, 1998 to April 7, 2003, though not always with the same continuity of dubbing (for details on the dubbing problems, see Ocean Group dubs and Funimation dub).
       In was also shown in Canada on YTV around the same time. It aired in the UK, with the same dubbing problem, on Cartoon Network, premiering on March 6, 2000 and running on that channel until 2002.
       The Majin Buu Saga, Fusion Saga and Kid Buu Saga were later broadcast on CNX, which later changed its name to Toonami, with the show ending on February 28, 2003.
       After the finished run, it was repeated daily, until Toonami merged with Cartoon Network Too.
       In Australia it was shown on both Cartoon Network and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation with Cartoon Network airing it in around 1997-1999 and ABC from 1999-2004.
       In New Zealand it was shown in TV3.</p>
    <p>In April 2009, a new 'refresh' of Dragon Ball Z began airing on Japanese television. This re-cut is titled Dragon Ball Z Kai.</p>
